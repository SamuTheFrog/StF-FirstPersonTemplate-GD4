# StF-FirstPersonTemplate-GD4
My first person template using gdscript within Godot. Imports direct into Godot.
# Features
* Lightweight, simple, easy to configure.
* Contains sprinting, double jumping and dodging. (Crouching, prone & more coming soon)
* Kinematic character body
* Smooth interpolation between start and stop velocity/movement
* Camera bob
* Velocity carries from ground > air & air > ground
* Slight Mid-Air movement, smoothly interpolated between starting velocity.
# Inspired by
Liked games like Metroid, early MoH and CoD, and Source(portal, l4d, hl2, gmod) games a lot. Another two classic favorites were SWBF2(2004), and a lesser known title, Enemy Territory Quake Wars.
I guess you could say I'm trying to reignite the fun I once had playing these classic titles and want to create my own sort of classic. A lot of my games will be using modified versions of this template I created, but I will be open sourcing this template for anyone else who wants to create a FPS style game.
# Enjoy
